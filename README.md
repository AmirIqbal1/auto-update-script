# auto-update-ubuntu-script
This script auto updates Ubuntu OS.

Run as root "chmod +x update.sh", then run the command "./update.sh"

This script will auto reconfigure dpkg if anything is wrong with it, update, upgrade and 
perform an "install -f" as well as, autoclean and autoremove any packages and downloaded files/ dependencies it doesn't need. 

It will also clean bash history. 

Great scripts for Ubuntu servers.
